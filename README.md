### Hi there!! ðŸ‘‹
**Glad to meet you !** :trophy: <br>
My [**Github**](https://github.com/Aditya-Kashyap) profile potrays my journey from writing **LOGO** in my Secondry School to MSDoS, then to first ***Hello world*** program in **JAVA** in my **HIGH SCHOOL** to the first **Commit** to my code in project many approx 5 years ago and currenty working with **PYTHON** and with many other languages. It has been a journey of consecutive Efforts and Failure and I look forward to more *Open Source* projects now. Apart from [Github](https://github.com/Aditya-Kashyap), I am always available and working on any other projects. Connect with me on [**LinkedIn**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditya-kashyap/). Make pull requests and I will be happy to review and merge them if required. Also please :star: if you like any, Much Appreciated :hugs:
