### Hey there! Hii ðŸ‘‹
**Glad to meet you!** :trophy: <br>
My [**Github**](https://github.com/Aditya-Kashyap) profile potrays my journey from writing program for **LOGO** in my Secondry School to MsDoS, then to first ***Hello world*** program in **JAVA** in my **High School** followed by the first **Commit** to my code in my college project many approx 5 years ago and currenty working with **PYTHON** and with many other languages in a company. It's an ongoing journey with consecutive Efforts and lots of Success and Failures.
Be sure to make pull requests and I will be happy to review and merge them if required. Also please :star: if you like any, Much Appreciated :hugs:
